# Dipole-Moment
Bash and Python scripts needed to handle information for the dipole moment project.
  # change.sh: change the basis set used in the computations for the augmented versions of the Pople-style basis sets (6-31G*, 6-31+G, etc.). This is is needed because they cannot be created with the Snakemake flow file.
